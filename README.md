# Rain-in-Australia
Analysis - EDA + FE + Modelling                                                                                                                               In this kernel, we will try to answer the question that whether or not it will rain tomorrow in Australia. We implement Logistic Regression with Python and Scikit-Learn.  To answer the question, we build a classifier to predict whether or not it will rain tomorrow in Australia. We train a binary classification model using Logistic Regression. I have used the Rain in Australia dataset for this project.
